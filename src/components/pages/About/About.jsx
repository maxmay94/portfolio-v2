              I am a full-stack software engineer and former bartender. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve found that every challenge can be overcome with a solid work ethic, strong communication, and a committed team. I love the creative and intellectual stimulation of solving a tough coding problem. I look forward to bringing my work-ethic and creativity with me into a new role as a software engineer.
